            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Sad Repreſentation <hi>of the uncertain and dangerous Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Common-wealth: By the Preſenters and Approvers of the Large</hi> Petition <hi>of the</hi> 11. <hi>of</hi> September, 1648.</head>
            <p>IF our hearts were not over-charged with the ſenſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſeries and approching dangers of the Nation, your ſmal regard to our late ſerious Apprehenſions, would have kept us ſilent; but the miſery, danger, and bondage threatned is ſo great, imminent, and apparent, that whilſt we have breath, and are not violently reſtrained, we cannot but ſpeak, and even cry aloud, until you hear us, or God be pleaſed otherwaies to relieve us.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhould you in reaſon be with-held from conſidering what we preſent you withal, through any ſtrangeneſs that appeareth there in; For what was more incredible, than that a Parliament truſted by the people to deliver them from all kinds of oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and who made ſo liberal effuſion of their bloud, and waſte, of their eſtates (upon pretenſe of doing thereof) ſhould yet ſo ſoon as they were in power, oppreſs with the ſame kind of oppreſſions, which yet was true in the times of <hi>Hollis</hi> and <hi>Stapletons</hi> faction, and who, (as the King and Biſhops had done before) laboured for an Army to back and perpetuate them therein.</p>
            <p>Nor were our Petitions then preſented (wherein we juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of thoſe oppreſſions, and fore-warned them of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:137372:3"/>
enſuing) the leſs conſiderable for their burning them by the hand of the common hangman; Nor the Petitioners the more blame-worthy for being reproched with the names of Atheiſts, Hereticks, and ſeditious Sectaries (as now with Jeſuite, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velier) Aſperſions being the known marks of corrupt Stateſ-men, and uſually working no other effect, but the diſcredit of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſers. Yet were there then many who believed their reports of us, and they were as impatient with us, for our taxing them with their wicked and pernicious deſigns, as others are now for our preſuming to detect them, who are ſo high in preſent power and repuration: But it is now evident, that it is poſſible for our Phyſitians to bring us into a more dangerous condition than they found us.</p>
            <p>And though experience hath made us wofully ſenſible, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more dangerous to any people than their bearing with unjuſt, covertous, or ambitions practiſes in thoſe they truſt; Yet did we forbear to interpoſe our judgements, or to oppoſe thoſe mens deſigns, until they had made a large progreſs toward our bondage, and endeavoured to graſp the power of the Army into their hands, thereby to enforce their Tyrannie upon us; inſomuch that it was almoſt too late to give check to their wicked intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: ſo unwilling were we to believe it poſſible for men who all along pretended liberty and redreſs of grievances, to degenerate ſo ſoon into the groſſeſt Principles and practiſes of long ſetled Tyrannies.</p>
            <p>And much more do our Conſciences bear us witneſs of our backwardneſs to believe any evil intentions in thoſe who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were moſt vigorous and ſucceſsful againſt the common enemy, but ſeemed ſo ſenſible of the injuſtice and trechery of that preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent faction in Parliament, as to engage with the utmoſt of their might, as if they had really intended to deliver the Nation from that dangerous thraldom, ſo that we both durſt, and did many of as, venture our lives upon their fidelity; Yea ſo powerful, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and contentful were their firſt Engagements, Papers, and Remonſtrances, to fraught with ſelf-denying Doctrines, tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the peace of the Nation, and ſatisfaction to all intereſts; as even lulled all peaceable People into a ſound ſleep of ſecurity, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting all their care upon the General Councel of the Army, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a People they thought could never have the face to decline ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe principles, or to neglect the performance of ſo many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:137372:3"/>
promiſes, and proteſtations, made as in the preſence of the all-ſeeing God, frequently calling upon him, the ſearcher of all hearts, to bear witneſs to their integrity and ſincerity therein: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that we (who alwaies with ſome warineſſe obſerved them) many times denyed our own underſtandings rather than we would draw haſty concluſions from evident teſtimonies of their defection.</p>
            <p>But when after they had once ſleighted the Agitators. and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced thoſe Officers and Souldiers, who firſt engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the deſtructive Votes of Parliament; ſuch as ſtood firm to their engagements at New-market, and Triploe Heath: when we ſaw they not only neglected them, but adhered to perſons ſent from Parliament and City, in thoſe corrupted times, and fell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to plead for Negative Voyces in the King, and Lords; checking and controuling th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe that oppoſed: When we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their General Councels (which according to their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought to have conſiſted only of two ſelect Commiſſion Officers, and two private Souldiers, choſen by every Regiment, with ſuch General Officers as aſſented to the Engagement, and no other) were nevertheleſſe overgrown with Collonels, Lieut. Collonels, Majors, and others, not choſen; and many of them diſſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers from the ſaid Engagement; and that ſome few emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons preſum'd above meaſure therein, and in effect over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed and controuled thoſe Councels: and that the contrivance of a Counſel of State, was the great engine which thoſe Councels la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to bring about: when we found them not only to Court the King, by kiſſing his hand, and the like, and that a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency was held between him and the General Officers, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents ſent to and fro continually, whereby they came to ſo neer a cloſe, as that their Propoſals were not only received, but corrected and amended by the King, before they were ſent to the Houſe, till they became very conſiſtent with his ends and Prerogative: and thoſe Officers ſo engaged thereby, as to be moved to impatience towards any that ſpake a ſillable againſt this their trafique and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with him: upon which likewiſe, they concluded an Agreement with the oppoſing Cittizens of London, without ſo muc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as calling the Agitators to advize thereupon. Seeing, Hearing, and Vnderſtanding theſe things, no marvel if we were ſtaggered in our Beleeſe of their integrity.</p>
            <p>But that a perſon ſo deeply charged as the Earl of Mancheſter, and other grand ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf-ſeekers of this Houſe ſhould be entertained with ſo great reſpect, and guarded to their places in Parliament,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137372:4"/>
and that notwithſtanding the prevailing power of the Army, thoſe who had uſurped the Authority of the Houſe, and Voted a new warre, were nevertheleſſe permitted to ſit and Vote there, and that contrary to the importunate deſires of the Agitators, and the Remonſtrance of the Army: and then one of the firſt fruits of this their conjunction was the paſſing of an Ordinance for Tythes, upon trebble dammages, which the corrupt Clergy had preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (in the abſence of the Speaker) to <hi>Pelhams</hi> Parliament; and the burning of Mr <hi>Biddles</hi> Book, by the Common Hangman; and impriſoning his perſon: and that notwithſtanding their glorious March through London, the prerogative Priſoners in the Tower, New-gate, and elſe where, were utterly neglected, and the Councel of thoſe friends ſleighted, who had been inſtrumental, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the loſſe of ſome, and the hazard of all their lives, to make an eaſie and unbloudy paſſage for the Army into Southwark and the City. Vpon obſervation of theſe and abundant more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which we could enumerate, we concluded, that the Councels of the Army were not ſteered as at their firſt engagement, by the ſelect perſons choſen thereunto, nor for the ends in that engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expreſſed; but by ſome other powerfull and; over-ruling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, that intended other matters then were pretended, a d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that laboured by all poſſible means to convert the honeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of good men in the Army, and elſe-where, and the happy ſucceſſ God had bleſſed them withall, to the advantage of their Luſts, Pride, and Domination: And as time came on, it more and more appeared, that they intended meerly the eſtabliſhment of themſelves in power and greatneſſe, without: any regard at all to the peformance of their promiſes and engagements, or any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the faith and credit of the Army, or to the peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of the Common wealth, and that they walked by no rules or principles either of honeſty or conſcience; but (as meer polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians, were governed altogether by accaſion, and as they ſaw a poſſibility of making progreſs to their deſigns, which courſe of theirs they ever termed a waiting upon providence, that with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Religion they might deceive the more ſecurely.</p>
            <p>Now that this may appear no ſlander, we entreat that without partiality, their after proceedings may be throughly ſcan'd: as firſt, at <hi>Kingſton</hi> it was propoſed by the Agitators, friends of <hi>London, Southwark,</hi> and the places adjacent, that the Tower, City, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:137372:4"/>
Borough, might be ſecured by the well-affected Inhabitants, and not by Souldiers, that ſo trade and traffique might be preſerved, which otherwiſe would be driven away (as it ſoon after proved) And that it was hoped they intended not to ſecure any place by Souldiers, when the wel-affected Inhabitants were able to ſecure it. Which adviſe proceeded as well from ourreſpects to the City and neighbour places, as upon fears of what we know to be the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of other Tyrants (and therefore doubted would be exerciſed by thoſe) namely, the gariſoning great Towns, thereby to keep the people, as well in poverty, as in continual aw and ſubjection.</p>
            <p>Which adviſe, though aſſented unto by the Agitators, was yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the grand Officers, and a new Regiment raiſed, to the further charge of the Common-wealth; the Propoſers themſelves being diſmiſſed with reproches, and the Agitators thruſt out, and not permitted to obſerve how they were dealt withal.</p>
            <p>At which time alſo its very remarkable with how much height of State they obſerved the King at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, viſiting him themſelves, and permiting thouſands of people dayly to viſit him, to kiſs his hand, and to be healed by him, whereby his party in the City, and every where, were exceedingly animated, his Agents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as familiar at the head-quarters, as at the Court. Then on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when the Houſe complyed not with their purpoſes, in all haſt it was to be purged, and thereupon they publiſh a large Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, <hi>Aug.</hi> 18. ſtuffed with publike reaſons, to ſhew the juſtneſs and neceſſity thereof: but the Houſe again complying, through the ſight of their Remonſtrance, though no whit changed in reſpect of its corruption; &amp; they finding, if it were purged, it would not be for their deſign; they make nothing of their former reſolution, but continue it in its corrupt condition, and ſit with them themſelves.</p>
            <p>Then they fall to work again about the King and ſend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of <hi>New-caſtle</hi> to him, which they knew, and were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed he ſhould not ſign; in the mean time, they ſo wrought the King by deep promiſes, and hopes of reſtauration, as that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Addreſſes of another nature to the King, they could not promiſe them the aſſiſtance of the Army; and according they take pains to work every man at the head-quarters; upon which, petitions were attempted in the Army, in favour of a Treaty, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious, but weak people, were drawn to ſecond their deſign, with a Petition for a Perſonal Treaty, which they had ready at the Houſe dore.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſtrange and myſterious proceedings occaſion'd a new face of things in the Army, many of the Officers being much diſtaſted thereat, &amp; whole Regiments chuſing new Agents to look after the publike, as fearing things were runing head-long into a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous condition: The far greater number of the Officers, would not by any means indure to hear of the Armies complaince with the King, and the Agents finding all former engagements, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and declarations broken, and utterly neglected, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth in danger of utter diſſolution, produce an <hi>Agreement of the People, upon grounds of Common Right, for uniting of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced people therein;</hi> the great Officers very much oppoſe it a while, as having ſet up another Intereſt: but ſeing the ſame take with the Army, profeſs <hi>though at preſent their judgements could not ſo far cloſe with it as to act for it, yet they would never oppoſe it.</hi> Hereupon the whole frame of the deſign alters, and the matters in projection with them, were how to diſ-ingage themſelves, and be rid of the King, and how likewiſe to diſcountenance and keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſcerning party in the Army. In order to the firſt, they caſt about how to get the King into the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where they might both eaſier keep others from him, and the more entirely poſſeſs him themſelves; and that he might with willingneſs be hurried thither, they work upon his fear; ſuggeſting to him, that there was an intention in ſome violent perſons to murder him, and perſwade him to leave that in a letter, as the cauſe of his remove. To make which the more credible, they wrought L. Col. <hi>Hen. Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> to aſperſe his brother <hi>John</hi> (who then ſtood in the way of the great men of the Army) with a baſe &amp; abhorrid reſolution of being one that intended to murder the King; to the proof whereof they would never ſuffer the Aſperſer to be brought (though ſolicited thereunto by a Petition from divers well-affected perſons) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed thereof, for that perfideous ſervice, they advanced him to the government of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> Caſtle, above his brother <hi>Robert,</hi> where
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:137372:5"/>
retaining the leven of his Apoſtacy, which the Gen. Officers had laid in him, he uſſered the deſerved reward of a perfidious traytor.</p>
            <p>And though the General Officers enclined him to this revolt themſelves, as well by their example, as by countenancing him in the beginning hereof; and though for the ſame he incurred the extreme diſpleaſure of his Father, and Kindred, yet are both his Father and Kindred by the Officers themſelves and their Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates aſperſed with the fact, as if tainted with guilt and contammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus did they kill two birds with one ſtone, framing a Name for them which of all others is moſt diſtaſtefull to the People, and was therefore moſt likely to beget a beleef of the pretended aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſination.</p>
            <p>Where (by the way) we deſire it may be obſerved, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the word <hi>Leveller</hi> was framed and caſt upon all thoſe in the Army (or elſewhere) who are againſt any kind of Tyranny, whether in King, Parliament, Army, Councel of State, &amp;c. And though it was not ſo much as beleeved to concern thoſe upon whom they caſt it, the inventers having often profeſſed as much, yet have they both themſelves and by their Inſtruments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly propagated the ſame, and inſinuated both this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlanders of us into the hearts of all the eaſy and credulous people they could meet withall.</p>
            <p>But to returne, The King thus removed, they judge themſelves at good leiſure to deal with the Agreers for the People, and ſo ſuddainly violent they became in that work, that at the firſt Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous neer Ware, they ſhot a Souldier to death, for purſuing the ends of the Engagement at New-market, and for inſiſting upon the Agreement for the People: unworthily abuſed Major <hi>Skott,</hi> a Member of this Houſe, ſent him up a priſoner, and accuſed him and Col. <hi>Rains borough</hi> for appearing in behalf of the Agreement, and there withall ſent Col. <hi>Ayres,</hi> Major <hi>Cobbet,</hi> Capt. <hi>Bray,</hi> and many others after them priſoners to Windſor, where, as Parties, Judges, and Juries, the Officers did what they would againſt them, ſentencing ſome to deata, others to diſgracefull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reſtraining and releaſing at pleaſure, and with as much Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birrarineſſe as ever was in the world, and could not be diſwaded though Mr <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> and others bore full reſtimony againſt the cruelty and injuſtice thereof. Hereupon at the Houſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured at once the impriſonment of five cordial Citizens, for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:137372:6"/>
the Agreement of the People, and requiring Juſtice for the blood of the Souldier that was ſhot at Ware, disfranchized them, and under the notion of London Agents forbad their meetings. And when now they thought they had moulded and qualified the Army to their own bent, and had gratified their complying Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with the cruelty upon the Levellers, (for ſo they have ſtiled all who have manifeſted any ſence of Common Right) and had found that they could be nothing ſo great, rich, and potent, upon a cloſe with the King, and that it would be impoſſible for them to hold either Officer or Souldier firm to them, in caſe of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure. Hereupon uterly to fruſtrate his hopes that way, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the Houſe to Vote no more Addreſſes; and ſo vaniſht away all their glorious flattery of the King and his Party, and their notorious diſſimulation appeared, abuſing thereby the Faith of the Army, and making it cleer to all diſcerning men, that ſuch as could ſo break with one ſort of men, will make no Conſcience of keeping faith with any.</p>
            <p>Their next work was to new-mould the City, and make it theirs, for which purpoſe they brought ſome Regiments of Horſe and Foot, to White Hall and the Muſe, to the extreme diſcontent of the City, and provoke them further by keeping their Lord Mayor, and ſome of their Aldermen in the Tower, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to a Legal Tryal, though upon Petitions and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Deſires: at laſt they were referred to be tryed by the Lords, contrary to the known Law of the Land; but their juriſdiction being diſclaimed, after a while they were releaſed without any Tryal at all, their end being accompliſht, which was the terror of the City, and changing the Magiſtrates thereof, ſo as ſhould beſt ſerve their deſignes.</p>
            <p>About this time alſo they began to exerciſe their Marſhal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over perſons not of the Army, and did ſentence Mr <hi>William Thomſon</hi> to death at White Hall. And then alſo they began to new moddel the Army, and for that end, (though the new raiſed Regiment for the Tower was thought no burthen, yet upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of eaſing the charge of the Common wealth, the Life-Guard muſt be disbanded, becauſe conſiſting of diſcerning men, faithfull to their Country and former promiſes, and many others of like principles were pickt out of every Regiment; the deſigne being by weeding the choiſeſt and beſt reſolved men, to make the Army wholy mercenary, ſlaviſh, and the Executioners of a few mens luſts and lawleſſe Pleaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:137372:6"/>
All which thoſe good men perceiving and reſolving thereupon not to be disbanded, according to the Agreement at <hi>New market,</hi> till the ends therein expreſſed were fully gained, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced there nto by <hi>Tyrannicall ſentences</hi> of <hi>Imprsonment</hi> and Death (though the Officers themſelves had formerly refuſed to disband upon command of <hi>Parliament</hi> upon the ſame grounds and ſtrength of the ſame engagement:) By all which 'tis evident, that acording to the <hi>maxime</hi> of <hi>Polititions,</hi> they judge themſelves looſe, where other men are bound; and that <hi>all Obligations</hi> are to them <hi>Tranſitory</hi> and <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> and that indeed every thing is good and juſt only, as <hi>it is conducting to their corrupt and ambitious Intereſts.</hi>

            <p>Certainly theſe things cannot but manifeſt unto you their very hearts, their inward purpoſes and Intentions repreſenting viſibly before you and all the World, the moſt dangerous condition, that ever yet this <hi>Nation</hi> hath been in: And if there be any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience towards God or man to be found amongſt you, the whol ſeries &amp; Progreſs of this our ſad <hi>Repreſentation</hi> is ſo fully known, and freſh in memory, that it is impoſſible, but it muſt work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all amongſt you that are not Co-partners with them in their <hi>Deſigne,</hi> or are not ingaged (as the Lawyers are) in ſome corrupt Intereſt.</p>
            <p>But though this long betrayed and miſerable Nation ſhould prove ſo unhappy as that there ſhould not be one found amongſt you, to own theſe known <hi>Truths,</hi> which yet ring in every mans ears, throughout the Land; but through feare, or other vile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſhould ſhut your eyes againſt the <hi>light:</hi> it ſhall be ſo farre from inducing us to repent of what we have herein (or in our late Apprehenſions) expreſſed, and ſet before you, that we ſhall rejoyce above meaſure, that we have witneſſed to the <hi>Trueth;</hi> and againſt all thoſe Deluſions and perfidious Stratagems lay'd by thoſe men to betray and enſlave the Common-wealth, to their owne Pride Ambition, Luſts, Covetouſneſſe, and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation if not Dukeſhip, or Kingſhip; their Creatures diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of late, <hi>That the Power muſt be reduced to One:</hi> What their meaning is, time <hi>(if they be not hindred)</hi> will manifeſt: but the Premiſes duly weighed, doth evidence, what ere it be, it will be as bad, as bad poſſibly can be.</p>

It being an infinite ſhame that they ſhould be ſuffered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſo farre therein, as they have done, there having beene no party hitherto ſo inexcuſable for it is poſſible, if not probable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that the King and his party might at firſt be induced to offend through error of breeding, long cuſtome, and ſway of times, (although that excuſe neither him nor them) That <hi>Hollis,</hi> and that party, might at firſt be drawne into their violence, againſt people faithfull to the Common wealth through an erronious zeale againſt ſuppoſed Sectaries, and for uniformity in Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery (though that alſo but little extenuates their offence) but neither the one nor the other can be imagined to have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt ſo evident light. nor againſt ſo many and great obligations of love, and great reſpects from the people as this party hath done; So that the in entions, and endeavours of theſe men, to enſlave the Common-wealth or their continuing of burthens, without any remorſe at the dearneſſe of food, and and utter loſſe of trade, exceeds in the nature and meaſure of it, all the wickedneſſe of both the other parties put together.</p>
            <p>And therefore upon due conſideration of the premiſes, and in utter deteſtation of their moſt perfidious and treacherous dealing with the Army, Parliament and Common-wealth; we do in behalf of our ſelves and all wel-minded people, here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Honourable Houſe, as in the preſence of Almighty God, proteſt againſt their breaking the ſaith of the Army with all parties, their diſſolving the Councel of the <hi>Agitators,</hi> and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a power of giving forth the ſence of the Army to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and people alſo againſt the ſhooting of the Souldier to death at <hi>Ware,</hi> and their cruelties exerciſed on other perſons, to the debaſing of their ſpirits, and thereby new moulding of the Army to their owne deſignes, then playing faſt and looſe with the King and his party, till they brought a new and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Warre upon the Nation.</p>
